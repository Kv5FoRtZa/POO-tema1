  ## This is my homework for OOP
  It was splited into 2 parts.
  # Part I
A console-based Chess game implemented in Java, following Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
The application supports user authentication, game persistence using JSON files, full move validation, scoring, and a Player vs Computer mode.

  Implemented Features:
Complete chess logic (without special moves like castling or en passant)
OOP architecture with clear class hierarchy (Board, Game, Player, Piece, etc.)
Move validation, check and checkmate detection
Scoring system based on captured pieces and game outcome
Custom exceptions for invalid commands and moves
Save and resume games using JSON files

# Part II
Extension of the Chess project with a Java Swing graphical interface and integration of multiple design patterns.

  Implemented Features:
Fully interactive 8x8 chess board (GUI-based gameplay)
Login, main menu, game screen, and end screen
Player vs Computer mode with automatic random moves
Game persistence and score tracking
